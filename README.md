A most simple extensible dictionary GUI written in Python 2.7, originally designed to conveniently keep track of the English translations of unique Japanese (city-esque) terms over a local network.  

This application makes use of Python's standard library, including the TkInter and SQLite 3 modules, as well as external packages such as Fuzzy Wuzzy (fuzzy matching), which  uses Levenshtein distance to calculate the differences between sequences of strings.
